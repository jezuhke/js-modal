## Vanilla JS modal

This is a simple modal plugin written in plain JavaScript. It uses CSS3 for transitions.

## Motivation

I needed a plugin without dependencies for my projects. I also practiced my JS skills with it. The modal is inspired by an article at scotch.io, "Building Your Own JavaScript Modal Plugin". Please visit their website for amazing hands-on tutorials.

## Using it

There are several examples of implementations at the end of the JS files. To test them, you'll need to uncomment the desired implementation.

## Contributors

This is just a simple plugin for my personal projects and to practice my JS abilities. You're more than welcome to contribute :)
